      "taskTitle": "Billing Management Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the billing management implementation into subtasks covering subscription details interface, upgrade/downgrade functionality, payment method management, billing history display, subscription cancellation flow, Stripe integration, and data fetching from Stripe.",
      "reasoning": "Billing management is complex due to the deep integration with Stripe, handling sensitive payment information, and implementing multiple user flows (upgrade, downgrade, cancellation). It requires careful state management and error handling."

      "taskId": 11,
      "taskTitle": "Station Overview Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the station overview implementation into subtasks covering station list interface, status component design, data fetching implementation, pagination, search/filtering, and loading/error states.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires fetching and displaying data from external sources with pagination and filtering. The complexity is moderate, focusing on data presentation and state management for loading and error conditions."

      "taskTitle": "Features Page Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 4,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the features page implementation into subtasks covering page layout design, feature section creation, visual element integration, responsive design implementation, and CTA placement.",
      "reasoning": "This is primarily a content-focused page with static information. The complexity is lower as it doesn't involve complex state management or data fetching, though it does require careful design for responsiveness and visual appeal."
    },
