# Title: Supabase Integration for Authentication
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Supabase authentication and implement auth context for the application
# Details:
Create a Supabase project and configure authentication settings. Implement auth provider context in React to manage authentication state. Create hooks for login, signup, logout, and password reset. Set up protected routes for authenticated content. Implement token refresh and session persistence. Create utility functions for Supabase client initialization and auth operations.

# Test Strategy:
Test user signup, login, and logout flows. Verify that protected routes redirect unauthenticated users. Test password reset functionality. Ensure token refresh works correctly.
