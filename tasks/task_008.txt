# Task ID: 8
# Title: Sign-up Flow Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the complete sign-up flow from plan selection to account creation, including Stripe Checkout integration and user onboarding.

1. Create sign-up flow sequence:
   - Plan selection on pricing page
   - Basic information collection (name, email, password)
   - Redirect to Stripe Checkout
   - Success page after payment
   - Redirect to onboarding or authenticated portal
2. Implement Stripe webhook endpoint to:
   - Receive successful payment notifications
   - Create new tenant and user in database
   - Assign appropriate subscription plan
3. Create API service to communicate with app.firegauge.app:
   - Send new user/tenant data
   - Receive confirmation of account creation
4. Implement error handling for failed payments or account creation
5. Add progress indicator for multi-step process
6. Create success page with next steps guidance
7. Implement email notifications for successful sign-up

# Test Strategy:
Test complete sign-up flow with Stripe test mode. Verify webhook handling and database updates. Test error scenarios and recovery paths. Verify email notifications are sent correctly. Test the flow on different devices and browsers.
