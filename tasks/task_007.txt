# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Dashboard Layout Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Redesign the Dashboard.tsx component to serve as a simplified user portal with a clean layout structure
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a new Dashboard.tsx component or refactor the existing one
2. Implement a responsive grid layout with a header, main content area, and optional sidebar

3. Query Supabase for user profile information (name, email, etc.)
4. Add functionality to fetch subscription plan details from the appropriate Supabase table
5. Implement loading states and error handling for data fetching
6. Create a context provider if needed to share user data across dashboard components

Testing approach:
- Test the hook with mock Supabase responses
- Verify error handling works correctly
- Check that loading states are properly displayed
- Ensure user data is correctly passed to child components

## 3. Create Subscription Plan and Quick Stats Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2

   - Number of users on the account
   - Any other relevant metrics
3. Add loading skeletons for when data is being fetched
4. Style both components to match the dashboard design
5. Connect components to the user data from subtask 2
